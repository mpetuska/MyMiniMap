This is an addon for "Elder Scrolls Online" game to provide a minimap functionality. It started of as a replacement of at the time
outdated [**MiniMap by Fyrakin**](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info605-MiniMapbyFyrakin.html), but now it's evolved into it's own addon.

### Development Tips & Suggestions
Bellow is a collection of tips and suggestions useful to know when working on any ESO addon.

#### IDE Setup
For best performance and clarity, [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) is the recommended IDE. Its community version is free and sufficient for
lua development.

#### Emmy Lua
To be able to work on lua projects, you'll first have to install the [Emmy Lua](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9768-emmylua)
plugin to IntelliJ. Optionally, you
can also download the binaries of your prefered version of [Lua](http://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/download.html) language.
These can then be set/added as your lua language sources by going *File > Project Structure > SDKs*, clicking the green plus and selecting
the root folder of the extracted binary.

#### ESOUI Source Code
Once you have Emmy Lua plugin setup, it's very useful to check-out [ESOUI](https://github.com/esoui/esoui) project and add its esoui directory to the project's
libraries. This can be done by going *File > Project Structure > Libraries*, clicking on the green plus button, selecting
"Lua Zip Library" and navigating to the esoui folder. After this is done, IntelliJ will start providing you code validation, information
and suggestion from the globally available ESOUI libraries. You can also use code navigation (CTRL + B) to quickly access any code object
coming from those libraries.

#### GitHub Issue Navigation
GitHub's issues can also be integrated into IntelliJ. This can be done by following these steps:
* Go *File > Settings > Tools > Tasks > Servers* and add a GitHub server via the green plus button. Fill up the required server 
details and you're done. Optionally, I'd suggest going into the *Commit Message* tab and enabling commit messages. Set the message
as `[{id}] {summary}` and it'll provide you a meaningful base for your commit messages each time.

Having this done, you can also explore the settings available to you in the *File > Settings > Tools > Tasks* menu.
* **Changelist Name Format**: Automatically configures a changelist name for your tasks. 
    > Recommended: `[{id}] {summary}`
* **Feature Branch Name**: Automatically names your feature branches for the tasks. 
    > Recommended: `feature/MPE {id} {summary}`
    
Furthermore, by going *File > Settings > Version Control*, clicking the green plus button and adding the following entry,
IntelliJ can be setup to automatically detect GitHub issue references and provide you with direct hyperlinks to the issue page.
* **Issue ID**: `([A-Z,a-z]+)\-(\d+)`
* **Issue Link**: `https://github.com/k33ny/$1/issues/$2`
